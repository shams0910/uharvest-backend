## Project description

 UHarvest, later re-branded as AgroMonitoring, is CMS software made for the Administration of Qashqadaryo Region, Uzbekistan, 
 to analyze, control and manage agricultural processes of the different types of crops in government lands.

Let's say government owns lands which it wants to rent out to farmers. Farmer rents the land (later in projects called as "contour")
and plant there different types of crops. Government should be able to monitor how the crops being maintained by farmers, e.i 
agricultural processes of the specific crop.

As farmers do not regularly use computers or smartphones, bridge being introduced between government and farmer to collect and put information into the system.
This role was named "supervisor". To put it simple, for now we have 3 types of users: government officer, supervisor and farmer.

#### crop description
Lets start with example. Imagine there is contour (a land) which farmer rented. Farmer plants there a cotton. Cotton has multiple agricultural processes like
soil preparation, manuring, irrigation and so on. Each one of the processes can last for 15 days up to 1 month in chronological order. Every day supervisor should 
enter the amount of land or crop being processed with which agricultural proccess. 
example: 10 hectars out of 100 was irrigated today in contour 245, which is assigned contour number
